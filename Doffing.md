## Prerequisites
1. Read the wiki: https://sto.fandom.com/wiki/Duty_officer	
You can't start until level 11.

2. Join a 
[Fleet](https://sto.fandom.com/wiki/Fleet).
You'll need to be in a fleet to donate your excess common doffs for 
[Fleet Credits](https://sto.fandom.com/wiki/Fleet_Credit),
and you will have a lot of excess to get rid of.
You'll want a fleet with reasonable access to buying at fleet stores, and one that has a full and active
[Armada](https://sto.fandom.com/wiki/Fleet#Fleet_Armadas)
so you have a variety of Contribution possibilities.

3. Make some coin (EC) and get stocked.  You should have at least a couple hundred thousand EC to buy supplies, etc without breaking the bank.  If you're a 
[Recruit](https://sto.fandom.com/wiki/Recruitment_event)
(Temporal/Delta/etc), completing the Klingon War chain will get you 2.5 million and you'll be rolling.  Then go stock up on the main Commodities.
(See [Commodities](#commodities) below).



4. Get set up with [DOFFTrekker](http://bit.ly/DOFFTREKKER3).
Once you get going, it can be frustrating to find the assignments you need
and deal with the cooldowns.  This Google Docs spreadsheet makes it easy.
The [DOFF viewscreens](http://bit.ly/DOFFS)
no longer seem to be actively updated, but for cooldown management it still works great.   If you don't want to use a Google account, you'll need some other way of recording cooldowns for each of the many assignments, or you'll waste a lot of time flying around sector space looking for assignments that are guaranteed not to be there.

When starting out your main focus should be on building your doff roster of blues and purples.  There's not much point to running the more valuable assignments until you have a much better chance of success/crit, and doff 
[quality](https://sto.fandom.com/wiki/Quality)
is the most important attribute in determining success/crit.

## The Basic Cycle of Assignments

To start with, you'll get the bulk of your blue and purples from the repeatable Asylum assignments
along with some one-time rewards from completing chains.

The basic cycle of assignments with their cooldowns (CD) goes like this:
|assignment										|duration|cooldown| purpose
|----------										|-------:|-------:| -----------
|[R&D Research Projects](#rnd)					|20h	|none	| to level your R&D Crafting
|[SFA Personnel Cadres](#cadre) (4)				|?		|96h	| to give whites for grinding 
|[SFA Cultural Exchange](#cultural) (3)			|?		|68h	| to give whites for grinding
|[Resettle Colonists](#resettle)				|4h		|28h	| to give Colonists to complete your Colonization Chains
|[Colonization Chain](#colonization) 1-7		|20h	|none	| to unlock the Support assignments
|[Support Colonization Efforts in \<node\>](#support)				|4h		|28h	| to give you Refugees for Asylums and a Purple on crit
|[Asylums](#asylum)								|20h	|44h	| to give you blues/purples
|[Consular Authority Chain](#consular) 1-4		|varies	|none	| to unlock Consular Officer Exchange
|[Consular Officer Exchange](#exchange)			|varies	|none	| to exchange your greens/blues/purples

NB: All cooldowns are taken from the START of the assignment.


It is tempting to buy greens from
[Lt. Ferra](https://sto.fandom.com/wiki/Ferra),
but beware that those are 
[ungrindable](#grinding)
(but the non-civilians can be
[Exchanged](#exchange))


## Doff Roster and Culling
You'll start out with 100 Roster slots and there are 47 main 
[Specializations](https://sto.fandom.com/wiki/Duty_officer#Specializations),
so two of each is a nice round number to start with, and you'll need 3-6 Research Lab Specialists for 
[R&D](https://sto.fandom.com/wiki/Research_and_Development)
leveling (as many as you have R&D slots unlocked), and room for a couple of transient 
[Refugees](https://sto.fandom.com/wiki/Specialization:_Refugee).

Until you get at least greens in each Specialization, you will have to be selective about which whites you want to keep (for assignments) and which you can grind (see [Grinding](#grinding) below).
I found the best way to do that is just use the Roster's Specialization filter one-by-one and look at how many doffs there are.  You can still make out the doff quality by the icon border while the pop-up menu is obscuring
most of the panel.
When you see a Specialization with more than 2 doffs, open your Armada or Personnel Officer to grind the excess away. The exceptions are the 3-5 Research Lab Specialists and any Refugees which you'll need for Asylum assignments.

Eventually when you have enough blues and purples, you can just use the Recent Recruits filter to see what your new rewards are and then just filter those specializations to see who to cull.

This can be a bit of a pain and you'll often end up with doffs in your inventory overflow (you can "Take All" to remove the ones that fit) and you'll need repeat cullings to get rid of any new ones you downgrind.

Note that doffs only can go into your Roster, not into your inventory.  Any that do not fit will go into your inventory 
[Overflow](https://sto.fandom.com/wiki/Inventory#Overflow_Bag)
(up to a max of 50 total overflow items).  The 
[Unbound](https://sto.fandom.com/wiki/Bound)
ones can be dragged from the Roster or Overflow into 
[Mail](https://sto.fandom.com/wiki/Mail)
or the 
[Exchange](https://sto.fandom.com/wiki/Exchange)
and grinding whites at Fleet can also take from the Overflow (but not the Personnel Officer).

Once you have at least all greens, you can bulk-grind whites without looking at them, so that is an important secondary goal.

## Grinding and Ungrindable Doffs {#grinding}
This isn't the usual sense of grinding, but rather about grinding up unwanted doffs to produce for other (better or worse) doffs or fleet credits.  (If that sounds grim, it's just a metaphor for e.g. sending 5 substandard doffs into workaday meat-grinder missions in exchange for a better 5X employee).

There are several ways of grinding unwanted doffs:

###	1. Fleet donations of Common (white) doffs.
Starbases need a lot of duty officers grinding away to keep them operational,
and you'll be donating a lot of whites for that. You get 300 FC for each one (if you choose the correct donation).

To do this, open your Fleet panel and the Armada tab and the Holdings subtab.
Select a Fleet from the Armada on the left side and open a Holding to see if there are any active Projects with doff Contributions that aren't yet filled up.  Yellow projects often have Engineering and Operations, red Tactical and Security, blue Science and Medical (but not always!), and sadly the Dilithium Mine for Civilians.
There are also generic "Common Duty Officer" contributions, but they only award 250 FC rather than 300, so leave them as a last resort.

Once you have at least 2 green doffs for each specialization, it gets much simpler and you can just use the Select All button to grind away whites.

### 2. Downgrinding ("Exchange Officers" - SFA Personnel Officer)
This is one way to get rid of greens/blues/purples you no longer want.  You get 3 of the lesser quality, free and immediately.
	https://sto.fandom.com/wiki/Personnel_Officer_%28Starfleet_Academy%29
If you need Fleet Credits, one Purple will downgrind into 27 whites worth 8100 Fleet Credits.

Another option is to exchange them (possibly upgrading) via a
[Consular Officer Exchange](#consular), but this only works for non-civilians.

Finally, if they are blue or purple you may want to send them to an alt or sell on the Exchange instead of downgrinding them.

### 3. Upgrinding ("Reassignment" - SFA Personnel Officer)
This converts 5 of your unwanted doffs plus some dilithium for one of the next higher quality.   It is not usually worth the cost in dilithium and lost Fleet Credits.

### Ungrindable Doffs
Some of your doffs will not be available for grinding.   This is *not* related to the 
[Bound](https://sto.fandom.com/wiki/Bound)
status (Bound-to-Character lock icon), but is an invisible trait.   It can often (but not always, particularly for Klingon) be determined by the presence of a quote at the bottom of its Dossier.

These are ones I've found to be ungrindable:
- Emergency R&D Holograms granted at level 15 or Replicated.
- doffs awarded by 
	[Recruit rewards](https://sto.fandom.com/wiki/Temporal_Agent_Recruitment#Duty_officers)
	(Temporal/Delta/etc).
- Any awarded or purchased from [Lt. Ferra's store](https://sto.fandom.com/wiki/Ferra)
- Any granted as part of a promo from the C-Store (e.g. Lower Decks)
- Bonus packs granted at levels 18, 23, 31, and 41 (XXX: maybe not)
- The blue Astrometrics Scientist Helna awarded by the final "Renown" mission of the Arucanis Colonization chain.

Ungrindable non-civilian doffs can still be disposed of usefully via the 
[Consular Officer Exchange](#consular) assignments.  Ungrindable civilians and whites can only be Dismissed or traded (if they are unbound).

## Sector Blocks {#sectors}

Sector 
[assignments](https://sto.fandom.com/wiki/Assignment)
appear under the Current Map tab while in sector space.
Shipboard assignments appear under the Department Heads tab.
These have independent reset timers listed on the left of your Duty Officer panel.

It can be frustrating to find the assignments you want.  It may seem flaky but it is in fact fairly predictable if byzantine.

Sector assignments are grouped by 
[Sector Blocks](https://sto.fandom.com/wiki/Sector_block)
which are a vestigal grouping of sectors that were removed from the game long ago, but still determine which sector assignments appear.

Unfortunately when they were removed, sectors were rearranged and misaligned with the old sector blocks with the result that it can be frustrating to get the true sector assignments to appear.

### Default Mystery assignments
When you didn't arrive in the correct manner, the Current Map assignments will be a default "mystery" set instead of the true sector assignments.  There seem to be two possibilities denoted by their top-most assignment:

1. "Scan Particle Geyser for Methogenic Particles"
2. "Purchase Prototype Heavy Phaser Turret"

If you see either of those at the top of your Current Map, you likely don't have the true sector assignments.
The true sector assignments will have missions (Military, Espionage, etc) that reference local systems in the Sector Block.

Things that will cause the default mystery assignments to appear instead of the true sector assignments:
- crossing a sector boundary within a Sector Block
- entering a sector by leaving a system 
- entering a sector by leaving a quadrant
- entering a sector by transwarping
- crossing invisible "border anomalies"

### Getting the True Sector Assignments
The true sector assignments will only appear when entering a Sector Block by travelling across the Sector Block border, and then often only for a few light-years of travel before you hit an invisible "border anomaly" which will reset the assignments back to a default. (In particular, the Qo'noS sector block assignments only appear in a very narrow strip on its western edge).

The best approach is to enter the Sector Block slowly (at minimum speed) and stop immediately when you see the sector notification.


This weirdness has been 
[mapped](https://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/3pdjod/mapping_sector_space_current_map_doff_missions/)
to some extent.  The maps with the Sector Blocks and border anomalies (blue lines) are reproduced below.

Note however that these maps are incomplete: there are additional unmarked border anomalies around various locations (e.g. there is an unmarked perimeter around the Vulcan system), and it is possible that some assignments can be found with higher likelihood in particular locations.
(XXX: I'm uncertain about whether these border anomalies only apply to Shipboard assignments or Sector Assignments as well).

#### Beta Quadrant:
Sector Block boundaries marked in yellow:
![Beta Quadrant Sector Blocks](img/Beta_oOkMb8V.jpg)

#### Alpha Quadrant:
Sector Block boundaries marked in pink:
![Alpha Quadrant Sector Blocks](img/Alpha_7GgueDP.jpg)


### Shipboard assignments
Some assignments might also appear under the Department Head (Shipboard) sections.
Notably, the Asylum and Officer Exchange Program assignments (which fall under the Recruitment commendation category), are often found under the Operations officer, so when you're looking for an assignment, you'll have to check both the Sector and Shipboard assignments.
The wiki usually lists the Commendation category for an assignment which you can use to determine which department to look under. 

Some commendation categories call fall under multiple departments.
For instance, Espionage assignments can fall under both the Tactical and Security departments.


## The Assignments

### General Notes
- Sometimes assignments will appear under the Department Head assignments instead of the Current Map,
so you'll always need to check there as well as the Current Map.

- Some assignments have 100% Success regardless of the doffs.  Don't use the default assigned doffs; select your lowest-quality doffs for those and reserve the higher-quality doffs for where it matters.   Keep an eye on the success chance though; you may need to assign one or two higher-quality doffs to keep it at 100%).

### R&D Research Projects{#rnd}
Once you hit level 15, you'll unlock R&D.  You should do your Research Projects daily to level up your schools.   The Research Project is the bottom assignment in each school, can be repeated every 20h, and gives 5000 or 6000 of Research XP.  You can do up to 3 Research Projects per school each day (but you'll need to unlock the slots).

Your first focus will be on unlocking 3 R&D slots. See the R&D Progress tab for unlock requirement (they go pretty quickly).   If you are a Recruit (Temporal/Delta/etc), be aware that you will soon get a Token to level up a school instantly to level 10:
	https://sto.fandom.com/wiki/Temporal_Agent_Recruitment#R.26D
so leave your most desireable school (e.g. Engineering or Beams) for
that token and start your leveling in your second-most desireable school.
Don't bother crafting any items until you're at least level 5 in that school with a decent crit chance.

You'll need a small supply of the common R&D Materials which you can get from Scanning during missions (or often cheaply on the Exchange in Reward Packs), and some Research Lab Scientist doffs.

You'll want at least 3 Research Lab Scientists to start and 5 or 6 later on.  If you're a Recruit (Delta, etc), don't forget you can claim a quick reward
after reaching level 1 of any R&D school that will give you a set of R&D doffs including a blue Research Lab Scientist.

### SFA Personnel Cadres {#cadre}
Found at the Personnel Officer in Sol Starfleet Academy.

### SFA Cultural Exchange {#cultural}
Found at in Sol Starfleet Academy at the three XXX
(Vulcan, Tellarite, Andorian).

### Colonization Chain {#colonization}
[https://sto.fandom.com/wiki/Assignment_chain:_Colonization](https://sto.fandom.com/wiki/Assignment_chain:_Colonization)

Completing this chain awards a Blue and then a Purple on crit (from the same specialization), but more importantly, unlocks a repeatable assignment
that rewards a Refugee which you'll need for the Asylum assignments.

Before you start on the chain, you'll want to stock up on Commodities.
See [Commodities](#commodities) below for best prices and quantities to get started.

To start a chain, travel in Sector Space to an
[Assignment Node](https://sto.fandom.com/wiki/Duty_Officer_Assignment_Node)
(which has a distinctive Duty Officer icon on the map).  The nearest one to Sol is the Delta Volanis Cluster.

The chain starts with the "Colony Site Survey in the \<node\>" assignment.
If it doesn't appear, you may have to wait for the next Sector Update (shown on the left side of the panel).
(See [Sector Blocks](#sectors) above).
	
It'll take a week or so to complete the chain for each node and there are 14 nodes, so look at the wiki to see which blue/purples you want to get first.
The final (7/7) 
["Renown"](https://sto.fandom.com/wiki/Assignment:_Renown)
assignment awards the blue doffs:

#### Support Colonization Efforts in \<node\> {#support}
The unlocked repeatable assignment awards a Refugee (and a purple on crit):
["Support Colonization Efforts in \<node\>"](https://sto.fandom.com/wiki/Assignment:_Support_Colonization_Efforts) (Fed Version).
These Refugees are used for the Asylum assignments.

For each node, the blue and purple rewards are of the same Specialization, except for Arucanis Arm Cluster which for some reason gives a second (ungrindable!)  blue Astrometrics Scientist: Helna.  (All the others are grindable).

NOTES:
	- You don't have to succeed at an assignment to unlock the next one in the chain.
	- You get repeat purples on crit and they are grindable so this can be a good source of blues.

### Resettle Colonists {#resettle}
[https://sto.fandom.com/wiki/Assignment:_Resettle_Colonists](https://sto.fandom.com/wiki/Assignment:_Resettle_Colonists)

A limiting factor for the Colonization chain is getting enough colonists to proceed.  You need three for step 2, four for step 3 and five for step 5, so make sure you do the Resettle Colonists assignment whenever it comes off of cooldown.   You should find it readily in most sectors when it is available.

Once all your Colonization chains are completed, there's no more use for these (although they are civilian whites than can be grinded for Fleet Credits).

### Asylums {#asylum}
[https://sto.fandom.com/wiki/Assignment:_Asylum_(Rare)](https://sto.fandom.com/wiki/Assignment:_Asylum_(Rare))

[https://sto.fandom.com/wiki/Assignment:_Asylum_(Very_Rare)](https://sto.fandom.com/wiki/Assignment:_Asylum_(Very_Rare))

Once the Colonization chain is complete, you'll unlock the final
"Support Colonization Efforts in \<node\>" assignment which awards a Refugee which is needed for the Asylum assignments.

Here are the available Asylum assignments and the desireable traits.
They are generally matched by the same species as the Asylum.
The location where they can be found is usually the entire sector block
(see [Sector Blocks](#sectors) above), but some can also be found inside specific systems (e.g. Sol and Vulcan).
(NB: the Sirius sector block is the one containing Vulcan sector).

These assignments can be found under either the Current Map (Sector assignments), as well as the Operations Department Head.

|assignment				|location 		|desireable traits
|---------				|-----			|------------------
|Asylum on Earth		|Sirius,Sol		|FF, Tactful, Teamwork
|Asylum on Vulcan		|Sirius,Vulcan	|FF, Tactful, Teamwork
|Asylum on Andoria		|Sirius			|FF, Emotional, Honorable
|Asylum on Betazed		|Sirius			|Telepathic
|Asylum on Rigel V		|Sirius			|Spiritual
|Asylum on Tellar		|Sirius			|FF, Stubborn
|Asylum on Caitian		|Sierra	block	|Aggressive, Emotional
|Asylum on Saurian		|Sierra	block	|Cold Blooded, Resilient
|Asylum on Bolarus IX	|Ponor block	|Congenial
|Asylum on Benzar		|Bajor block	|Efficient, Logical
|Asylum on Trill		|Bajor block	|Teamwork

You'll usually want to match the Refugee to the assignment to get the best chance at a crit (blue/purple).
However, some assignments are fairly rare (e.g. Tellar) while the
Tellarite Refugees are fairly common, so if you're running out of roster space, it might be worth sending them on a non-optimal Asylum assignment.

### Consular Authority Chain {#consular}
https://sto.fandom.com/wiki/Assignment_chain:_Consular_Authority

There are four chains and they are all found in the Alpha quadrant sector blocks and sometimes in specific locations near border intersections in those blocks.

As a Fed, you'll want to focus on the Karemman one first since you'll end up with a lot of human doffs with Honorable and Teamwork traits which are perfect for critting the Karemman Officer Exchange mission.

Note that the individual steps fall in different commendation categories and so will fall under different Department Heads (e.g. Security, Engineering), so make sure you are looking under the correct Department Head.

_NB: IMPORTANT!_   The final step 4/4 requires up to 4 Advisors or Diplomats which will **BE REMOVED FROM YOUR ROSTER**.
(XXX It appears that the first chain requires four XXX, but subsequent chains only require 1).
When you're doing this chain, keep an eye out for expendable white Advisors/Diplomats you can use for this.
In a pinch, buy one from the Exchange (use e.g. your Azura trade freigher).

### Consular Officer Exchange {#exchange}

[https://sto.fandom.com/wiki/Assignment:_Officer_Exchange_Program](https://sto.fandom.com/wiki/Assignment:_Officer_Exchange_Program)

This is the repeatable assignment that is unlocked by the Consular Authority Chain.  This takes any non-civilian doff and exchanges it for one from the named species, with a fair chance at critting and improving the quality.

When committing an officer, it is much more important to match at least one good trait than avoiding bad traits.

|assignment						|good traits				|bad traits|
|----------						|------------				|----------|
|**Federation**
|Bajoran Officer Exchange		|Spiritual					|Logical, Unruly
|Paradan Officer Exchange		|Logical, Unscrupulous		|Emotional, Unruly
|Karemman Officer Exchange		|Honorable, Teamwork		|Aggressive, Unruly
|Cardassian Officer Exchange	|Efficient, Eidetic			|Emotional, Unruly
|**KDF**|
|Dosi Officer Exchange			|Aggressive, Cunning		|Tactful, Honorable
|Ferasan Officer Exchange		|Aggressive, Unruly			|Logical, Peaceful
|Wadi Officer Exchange			|Congenial, Tactful			|Aggressive, Unruly


## Commodities {#commodities}
